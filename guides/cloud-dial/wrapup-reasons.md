# Wrap Up Reasons

A Wrap Up reason allows the agent to click a single button when ending the call to signify the outcome of the call for easy reporting.

It is now possible to assign your Wrap Up reasons to a category. This means when creating a campaign, you can add all the Wrap Up reasons in a category with a single click.

This guide will show you how.
