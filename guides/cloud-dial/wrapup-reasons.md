# Wrap Up Reasons

A Wrap Up reason allows the agent to click a single button when ending the call to signify the outcome of the call for easy reporting.

It is now possible to assign your Wrap Up reasons to a category. This means when creating a campaign, you can add all the Wrap Up reasons in a category with a single click.

This guide will show you how.

From the '**_Category_**' dropdown menu, you can either select an existing category to add to, or create a new category.

Give you Wrap Up reason a descriptive name (This will be what the Agents will see).

On this screen you can still manually add adhoc Wrap Up reasons by simply typing them in and clicking '_**Save**_' however you can also choose to add all of the Wrap Up reasons from a category by selecting the category from the dropdown menu.

::: tip
You can even add multiple categories to the same campaign.
