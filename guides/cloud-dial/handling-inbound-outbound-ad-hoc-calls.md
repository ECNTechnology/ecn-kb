## Description

When an Agent logs into Cloud Dial they will be greeted with the following screen.

Click '**Manual Dial**' to call a number that's not part of an Active Campaign.

On this page there is two ways to dial:

* You can use the search functionality to search all of your current campaigns for a number to dial.
* You can also simply enter the number directly and click '**Call**'.

::: tip
You can select any number assigned to Cloud Dial to be used as the '**From Number**'.
:::

Click '**Call**' to dial the number.

While on the call you will see the familiar call screen and will be able to perform the following actions:

* Stop / Start Call Recordings.
* Mask Recordings (This mutes the recording so that you can take credit card payments off the record for compliance).

Click '**End Call**' when finished.

## Inbound calls not part of an active campaign

Inbound calls that are not part of an active campaign will now ring through to Agents based on the skills based routing.
