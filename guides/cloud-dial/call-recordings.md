# Call Recordings

::: tip
**New Feature:** In order to meet PCIDSS Compliance, we have enhanced the call recording functionality to enable an Agent to '**mute**' a recording while taking payment or other personal information.
:::

While an Agent is on an active call, they will be offered the following call recording options:

* **Start/Stop Recording this Arrangement:** When '**started**' the main call recording will continue to run, and a _new_ recording will be started. This enables you to capture just the relevant part of the call into a small file. 
When '**stopped**', only the arrangement is stopped and the main recording will continue to record.

* **Stop All Recordings:** This will **stop** all recordings, including any arrangements. 

* **Mask/Unmask Recording:** This will mute the audio the recording. (Typically used while taking credit card payments).
