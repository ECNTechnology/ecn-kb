# Holiday Conditions

A '**Holiday Condition**' works in a similar way to a [Day/Night Condition](https://kb.ecn.net.au/guides/mycloudpbx/day-night-conditions.html) however it's intended purpose is a bit different.

Where a Day/Night condition is used **every week**, a holiday condition lies dormant until a **specific date**.

Simply configure the dates you will not be in the office (Christmas, New Years, etc) and set a custom action to take place on that date, such as a custom voicemail message.

::: tip
**Note:** A Holiday Condition starts from 12.01AM to 11.59PM.
