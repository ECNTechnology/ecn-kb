### Account Code

#### Background information about Account Codes

Account codes are used to attribute calls to either a user or group of users. 
Alternatively, account codes can be used to attribute calls made to your customers. 

When a call is made, you can enter the account code as part of the phone number. 
The code will show up in the CDR (Call Detail Recording) with call length, number dialled etc. 
The CDR record is written when you terminate the call.

This functionality would typically be used by anyone who bills specifically for their time, eg: lawyers.

The '**Account Code**' report takes each call with account codes  and assigns them a dollar value.
