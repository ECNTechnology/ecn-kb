# Office & Users

An office is a logical grouping of extensions. This group has it's own **areacode**, **timezone**, **outbound** **caller ID**, and [**music on hold**](https://kb.ecn.net.au/guides/mycloudpbx/music-on-hold.html).

## Create or Modify an Office

On this screen you can quickly see the relevant information about each '**office**':

* **Default Phone:** This is the default outbound caller ID that each extension part of this office will use. (Unless otherwise specified).
* **Hold Music:** This is the hold music that will be played in the even you place someone on hold. (**Note:** This is specific to **outbound** calls only.)
* **Default Area Code:** This is the default area code that will be used when an extension part of this office does not specify one when making a call.
* **Timezone:** This affects the clock shown on the handsets.
