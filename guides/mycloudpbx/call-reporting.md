There is a fundamental difference between these two reports.

**'Total Call Count' report:**

* for each 'inbound' call from the public network only show once.

**'Inbound Calls' report:**

* if an inbound call from the public network is transferred to another agent internally, that call will be counted against both agents.

This is why you get more calls in the 'inbound calls' report (as the calls have been transferred around the office).
