# Types of nbn available

There are many different types of nbn available. The difference between each connection type comes down the the underlying network technology connecting to the nearest available fibre node.

## Fibre to the Building (FTTB)

Fibre to the Building (FTTB) is typically used when connecting apartment / commercial buildings to the nbn network.

In this instance nbn will run a fibre optic line to the fibre node in the buildings communications room before using existing network infrastructure within the building to each residence.

### Connecting your modem

**Note:** You will require a VDSL2 compatible modem. ECN can pre-configure and ship a modem to your door, simply click the option when prompted on our online ordering form <a href="https://ecn.net.au/home-solutions/">here</a>.

If you elect to supply your own modem, it simply has to be VDSL2 compatible.

Your modem will connect into the existing telephone wall socket. This should be the *first telephone socket* in the property and is typically closest to the door.

**Note:** If you have more than one socket within the premises or have old telephones / adsl modems plugged in, this will likely degrade the performance of the new nbn connection.

If you have installed a *new line* specifically for the nbn, then you may need additional cabling performed from the MDF to the desired location within your premises - This will need to be performed by a licensed cabler arranged by the building management.

### What speeds can I expect from FTTB?

Fibre to the Building services can be delivered at a range of speeds to your buildings communications room.

Your actual speeds can be affected by a number of factors including:

* Cabling throughout your building.
* Modem quality and performance.
* WiFi signal strength.
* Your nbn tier selected.

## Fibre to the Premises (FTTP)

Fibre to the Premises (FTTP) connections will have a fibre optic line connecting from the nearest fibre node, directly to your premises.

### Connecting your router

Your FTTP connection may require additional hardware to be installed by nbn within your premises.

A licensed nbn contractor will install the nbn utility box to the outside of your property before running the fibre through the wall to the internal nbn connection box.

The internal nbn connection box will be powered by a battery backup system allowing the Internet to function during minor power outages.

Once your FTTP order has completed ECN will tell you which "UNI-D" port to plug your router into on the nbn connection box. (These ports will be labelled clearly and allow for up to four data services to be run at a time).

### Where will the nbn provided equipment be installed?

Prior to your nbn installation, you will need to decide where you want your nbn connection box & power supply to be installed.

Use the following checklist to pick your preferred location:

* Close to a convenient power point with two available sockets.
* The area must be cool, dry and well ventilated. (no kitchens, bathrooms, under an open window etc.)
* Not in a high traffic area where it may be bumped or damaged.
* It should be easily accessible to see and check the indicator lights.
* Not in a seperate garage / outhouse).

The nbn technician will attempt to accommodate your requests, however you should have an alternate location in mind incase your first choice is unsuitable.
