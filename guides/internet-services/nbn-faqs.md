# Types of nbn available

There are many different types of nbn available. The difference between each connection type comes down the the underlying network technology connecting to the nearest available fibre node.

## Fibre to the Building (FTTB)

Fibre to the Building (FTTB) is typically used when connecting apartment / commercial buildings to the nbn network.

In this instance nbn will run a fibre optic line to the fibre node in the buildings communications room before using existing network infrastructure within the building to each residence.

### Connecting your modem

**Note:** You will require a VDSL2 compatible modem. ECN can pre-configure and ship a modem to your door, simply click the option when prompted on our online ordering form <a href="https://ecn.net.au/home-solutions/">here</a>.

If you elect to supply your own modem, it simply has to be VDSL2 compatible.

Your modem will connect into the existing telephone wall socket. This should be the _first telephone socket_ in the property and is typically closest to the door.

**Note:** If you have more than one socket within the premises or have old telephones / adsl modems plugged in, this will likely degrade the performance of the new nbn connection.

If you have installed a _new line_ specifically for the nbn, then you may need additional cabling performed from the MDF to the desired location within your premises.

### What speeds can I expect from FTTB?

Fibre to the Building services can be delivered at a range of speeds to your buildings communications room.

Your actual speeds can be affected by a number of factors including:

* Cabling throughout your building.
* Modem quality and performance.
* WiFi signal strength.
* Your nbn tier selected.
